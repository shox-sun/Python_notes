    "This tutorial is based on [this site](https://pythontips.com/2013/08/07/the-self-variable-in-python-explained/).I was learning DFA about binary tree and I need to store node infromation in a new class. The question is broke into building a easy-to-use class and I think self variable in python is quite necessary. "

Someone also filed a PEP (improvement suggestion) in which he suggested to remove the explicit assignment of self keyword. However Guido Van Rossum (the maker of python) wrote a [blogpost in which he told why explicit self has to stay](http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html)."
